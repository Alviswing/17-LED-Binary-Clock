#Presentation

Here is a quick overview of the design of my binary clock.

I wanted to create a minimalistic clock and learn to plan a electronic circuit by making this project.

I wanted to avoid as much as possible printed circuit chip and staying as close as possible to transistors and other basic component.
However due to reduce the overall size and to simplify the overall design I decided to partition the Blueprints in sub-modules.

This repository aim to present the different modules of my clock alongside explanations.
